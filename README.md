It has been developed to be used **only by Ironhackers**, and it's really simple and easy to use.

By giving each Ironhack a profile within an internal social network, it becomes possible to centralize all the necessary tools for the community, such as a communication space, called *Agora*, educative resources, and a list of all Ironhackers with a view of their profiles so that they can be in touch.

### Educative Resources

Ironhackers is intended to keep students and graduates in constant communication as well as give them access to the constant change of technology.

This is achieved by linking the "Ironhack's learnings" with extra resources, giving the opportunity to improve the training of the Ironhackers.
